# Weather_with_Python
I have created a python script and teamed up with OpenWeatherMap API to visualize the weather of 
500+ cities across the world using various distance from the equator. I built a series of scatter plots
that showcase the following relationship: 
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
